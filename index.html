                <h3>Web Development</h3>
                <p>I am a skilled and passionate Web Developer with experience in building responsive, user-focused websites and web applications. My core development stack includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and PHP for backend functionality. I’ve successfully developed and deployed systems like online booking platforms, farm management systems, and personal portfolios—tailored to meet both individual and institutional needs.

                    I pay close attention to structure, functionality, and design, ensuring each project is not only beautiful but also intuitive and scalable. Whether working on a solo project or collaborating with others, I approach every challenge with a focus on clean code, great user experience, and performance optimization.</p>

                <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
                <p>As a Graphic Designer, I specialize in creating compelling visual content that communicates clearly and leaves a lasting impression. From logos and branding kits to flyers, posters, social media graphics, and UI assets, my designs are rooted in creativity, clarity, and consistency.

                    I’ve worked with students, startups, and personal brands to help them establish a strong visual identity. Using tools like Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Canva, I craft visuals that are not only aesthetically appealing but strategically effective in delivering messages and capturing attention.</p>

I couldn’t have completed my project without him!</p>

Ongeri Ongeri walked me through everything, from backend coding to frontend design using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. His guidance made a huge difference in my confidence and understanding. I now have a working system I’m proud to present—thank you for making this possible!</p>
